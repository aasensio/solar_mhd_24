# Solar MHD 2024

Repository containing the notebooks used for the lecture on the [Solar MHD 2024](https://pdg.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/seminars-and-conferences/solar-mhd-2024) meeting. 

## Classical machine learning
The notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rxEN3-M2Oj_nLIFx6apLbXRyInluRuib?usp=sharing). It shows the application
of principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means to real observed Hinode data. It also discusses the application of a simple
neural network for regression, showing the main ingredients of how to train a neural network in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).


## Complex neural networks
The notebook can be found  [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_vLI64b30vBHPChaCZg6pFbOy9Y12anE?usp=sharing). It shows
a much more elaborate application of neural networks to observations, focusing on using implicit neural representations or neural fields for the
inference of physical properties from data.
